<b>Description</b>

Use <i>ActivateByNum</i>, an AutoHotkey (v1.0.46+) http://www.autohotkey.com/ script, to quickly switch to a window according to its order on the Windows taskbar (it works with only the first 10 windows).

<b>Windows Logo Key :windows:+1</b> switches to the first window on the taskbar and <b>Windows Logo Key :windows:+2</b> the second, etc. For a collapsed group of window buttons, repeatedly pressing the same <b>Windows Logo Key :windows:+n</b> combination (where <b>n</b> is the position of the group on the taskbar) will cycle through each window in the group (this behavior is similar to the Superbar in Windows 7).

Download the standalone executable here. The source code (AutoHotkey script) is also available at the Google Code page: http://code.google.com/p/activatebynum/downloads/list

<b>Update June 6, 2009</b>

Incorporated a few suggestions from :devfriele80:
<b>1.</b> Numpad keys work now
<b>2.</b> The target window will be minimized if it's already active (only for windows not in any collapsed group)

<b>Other recommended utilities</b>

<i>ActivateByNum</i> works best when used with <i>Taskix</i> http://taskix.robustit.com/ or <i>Taskbar Shuffle</i> http://nerdcave.webs.com/ for rearranging taskbar buttons and <i>Taskbaric</i> http://sw2.deviantart.com/art/Iconize-Taskbar-Buttons-108127143 for iconizing taskbar buttons.
